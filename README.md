# SerialOS
 ~~An attempt at Linux from scratch~~ A really light Arch-based Linux distro for my friend's ThinkPad.
## Installing
### Installing in QEMU
1)  Download [boot.img](https://github.com/aHumanWithAName-commited-arson/SerialOS/releases/download/Release/boot.img)
2) Install QEMU
3) Run 'qemu-system-x86_64 -hda path/to/SerialOS.iso'

### Installing on real harrdware

Idk, I haven't ran it on real hardware before so I'm not sure how to do this. Honesly, This OS is NOT ready to be ran on real hardware.
